1. Stooge sort is the recursive algorithm 
2. pseudo code:
   a. If the value of the first element of the array is greater than the last element, then swap these elements.
   b. 
3. Recurrence relation for the stooge sort algorithm is: **3T(2n/3) + c**
4. Crticial OPerations:
   a. 3 recursive sort calls
   b. 2 comparisons
   c. Exchange values
   d. Calculating the pivot index
