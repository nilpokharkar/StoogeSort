# StoogeSort

1. Stooge sort is the recursive algorithm 
2. pseudo code:
   - If the value of the first element of the array is greater than the last element, then swap these elements.
   - 
3. Recurrence relation for the stooge sort algorithm is: **3T(2n/3) + c**
4. Crticial OPerations:
   - 3 recursive sort calls
   - 2 comparisons
   - Exchange values
   - Calculating the pivot index
